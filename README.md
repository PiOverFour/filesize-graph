# Filesize Graph

An experimental image sequence size visualiser

## Introduction

This utility may be used in animation or VFX studios, or any environment where
you'd need to visualise the size of files (generally compressed images) in a
sequence.   It was developped at animation studio [Les Fées
Spéciales](http://les-fees-speciales.coop/) from a previous
[prototype](https://github.com/LesFeesSpeciales/filesize-graph) in Blender —
yeah, I'm real original with names.

The main use case is during rendering of long and heavy image sequences, to
check for missing frames, empty frames, or other rendering glitches, including:
* file corruption
* missing objects
* rig or animation glitch / jerky movements
* missing render passes
* an old version of an image has remained while overwriting the sequence
* generally, anything which would cause a specific image to be significantly
more different from its neighbours than is expected.

It relies on the fact that a given animated shot usually behaves in a smooth,
continuous movement, and does not jump everywhere. Otherwise, it may be called a
*cut*, and then it's not the same shot anymore.  
It also relies on the fact
that two images that look roughly the same tend to have roughly the same size
once compressed. So, if you have a big discontinuity, you just may have a glitch
worth investigating in an image.

Please note that it is not magical, and does not exempt you from checking the
sequence with your own or someone else's eyes. But it did relieve some stress on
long rendering nights preceding deadlines.

## Getting Started

To open an image sequence, use File → Open Sequence and select a file from your
sequence, or drag and drop a file to the window.  
A graph will appear in the left pane, a list of images represented as squares in
the right pane.  
Sequences are assigned a colour to help identify them.  
Missing images appear as a red point in the left pane, and as a red square in
the right pane.

You can navigate the graph by using the middle mouse button to pan. Zoom by
using the mouse wheel, or CTRL + middle mouse button to zoom either axis.  
You may also click “Zoom To” in the list pane to frame the sequence in the graph
view.

In this example, you may also notice a drop in the graph, which means that an
image in the sequence is lighter than those surrounding it. This may be worth
investigating... By hovering the point, a popup appears, which indicates the
file size, name and frame number.

![Light image](doc/light_image.png)

If part of the sequence appears corrupted or otherwise needs re-rendering, you
can select it by clicking and dragging on the graph, and selecting “Delete
Selected” in the list pane. Note that you can use the SHIFT and CTRL modifier to
add to or subtract from the selection, respectively.


### Installing

Latest binary releases may be found [here](https://github.com/PiOverFour/filesize-graph/releases).

### Building from source

You will need to install the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/)
version [3.0.6](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.0.6/), as well as
the matching export templates.

To compile from source, download or clone the project and open it in the Godot
Engine editor, and follow the procedure outlined
[here](https://godot.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/getting_started/workflow/export/exporting_projects.html).
Alternatively, you can use the command line instructions described on [this
page](https://godot.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/getting_started/editor/command_line_tutorial.html#exporting).

On GNU/Linux, I use the following command:

```bash
cd filesize-graph
mkdir -p export/filesize-graph.x11/
godot --export "Linux/X11" ./export/filesize-graph.x11/Filesize-Graph.x86_64

cd export
strip filesize-graph.x11/Filesize-Graph.x86_64
upx filesize-graph.x11/Filesize-Graph.x86_64
zip -r filesize-graph.x11.zip filesize-graph.x11/*
```

`strip` and `upx` are used to get a lighter binary, stripping debug symbols and
compressing the binary, respectively. More about these can be read
[here](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/compiling/optimizing_for_size.html).
